This is Jonathan Mikler's display webpage, currently in progress...

TLDR:
* LinkedIn is the best place to find me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)
* My CV is available here: [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvdHvv4T7Xp73bHWNpFuCBi6a5ovq2GX/view?usp=drive_link)
* Currently pursuing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.

This is GitHub, so let's talk code. You can find some of the repositories I've created or worked with enough that forking them made sense [here](https://github.com/ionymikler).

Here are some posts related to the topics I've studied:
1. [A Midsummer's Bayesian Dream](bayesian/midSummer_Bayesian.md): Something cool I learned in a logical theories class.
2. On the topic of Logic: I studied how epistemic logic could be used to help in the learning process of reinforcement learning agents. This was the final work of the same cool class mentioned above. The work is available [here](logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf) and was done together with [Elle McFarlane](https://github.com/ellemcfarlane).

I've taken some pretty neat courses so far:
1. Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)
2. On the topic of RL: I'm currently studying how Reinforcement Learning works in Multi-Agent Systems, on a special course dedicated to the subject. Nothing too crazy yet, but I'm sure I'll have something to share (hopefully).

This website is a work in progress...
