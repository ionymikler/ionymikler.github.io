This is Jonathan Mikler's display webpage, currently in progress...

TLDR:
* LinkedIn is the best place to find me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)
* My CV is available here: [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZU4Mqzy72IL_R7KR-ndILqpjZupWLtq?usp=drive_link)
* Currently pursuing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.
* The code to some of my projects can be found [here](https://github.com/ionymikler).

Here are some posts related to the topics I've studied:
1. On the topic of Logic: I studied how epistemic logic could be used to help in the learning process of reinforcement learning agents. This was the final work of that class. The work is available [here](logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf) and was done together with [Elle McFarlane](https://github.com/ellemcfarlane) a great AI engineer if you need one.
2. [A Midsummer's Bayesian Dream](bayesian/midSummer_Bayesian.md): Something cool I learned in a logical theories class (Under process...)

I've taken some pretty neat courses so far:
1. Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Agent Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02285)
2. Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)
3. Advanced Deep Learning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02506)
4. Perception for Autonomous Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/34759)
5. Logical Theories for Uncertainty and Planning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02287)
6. On the topic of RL: I'm currently studying how Reinforcement Learning works in Multi-Agent Systems, on a special course dedicated to the subject. Nothing too crazy yet, but I'm sure I'll have something to share (hopefully).

This website is (always) a work in progress...
