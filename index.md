# Hello (dear) World!
This is Jonathan Mikler's Display webpage, in progress of being built...\\
For now my LinkedIn is the best place to find me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)\\
My CV is also available here [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvdHvv4T7Xp73bHWNpFuCBi6a5ovq2GX/view?usp=drive_link)

For now, I'm doing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.\\
Taken some pretty neat courses so far:\\
1. Advance Deep Learning for Computer Vision [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)
2. [A MidSummer's Bayesian Dream](midSummer_Bayesian.md). Something cool I learn in a logical theories class. 

This website is in the making....
