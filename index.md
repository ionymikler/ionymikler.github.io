This place serves a double purpose.
1. As an archive of work I've done before, for now with the purpose of showing potential employers what I've done.
2. As a place to share some of the things I've learned and found interesting.

**TLDR:**
* I am a Robotics Engineer in love with his field. Mobile Robots is the what and Reinforcement Learning is the how.
* Currently pursuing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.
  * The code to some of my projects can be found [here](https://github.com/ionymikler).
  * My CV is available here: [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZU4Mqzy72IL_R7KR-ndILqpjZupWLtq?usp=drive_link)
  * LinkedIn: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)

This website is (**always**) a work in progress...

## I've taken some pretty neat courses so far:
1. Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)
   1. Main project: Detection Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection. The code is available [here](https://github.com/esquivelrs/MonoDETR)
   2. Other projects:
      1. Visual Transformer for Image Classification
      2. Diffusion Models to Generate (guided and not) 16x16 game sprites.
      3. Novel View Generation with NeRFs (my favourite)

2. Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Agent Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02285)
   1. Main Project: Multi-Agent 'traditional' planning with PDDL; planner algorithms for multi-agent systems. [Code](https://github.com/ionymikler/MultiAgentPlanner)

3. Advanced Image Analysis Learning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02506)
    1. Main Project: Probabilistic Deformable Models for Image Segmentation. [Poster](courses/adv_img_analysis/AdvImgAnalysis_Poster.pdf)

4. Perception for Autonomous Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/34759)

5. Logical Theories for Uncertainty and Planning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02287)
   1. Main Project: Epistemic Logic for Reinforcement Learning. [Report](courses/logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf)

6. On the topic of RL: I'm currently studying how Reinforcement Learning works in Multi-Agent Systems, on a special course dedicated to the subject. Nothing too crazy yet, but I'm sure I'll have something to share (hopefully).

## Here are some blog posts related to the topics I've studied:
1. On the topic of Logic: I studied how epistemic logic could be used to help in the learning process of reinforcement learning agents. This was the final work of that class. The work is available [here](courses/logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf) and was done together with [Elle McFarlane](https://github.com/ellemcfarlane) a great AI engineer if you need one.
2. [A Midsummer's Bayesian Dream](bayesian/midSummer_Bayesian.md): Something cool I learned in a logical theories class (Under process...)

## Other projects:
I develop on a need-to-have basis these too `shell` toolboxes:
1. Generic Shell Toolbox: [Shell Toolbox](https://github.com/ionymikler/generic_shell_toolbox)
2. ROS Shell Toolbox: [ROS Shell Toolbox](https://github.com/ionymikler/ROS_shell_toolbox)
