This is Jonathan Mikler's Display webpage, in progress of being built...

TLDR:
* LinkedIn is the best place to find me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)
* My CV is available here [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvdHvv4T7Xp73bHWNpFuCBi6a5ovq2GX/view?usp=drive_link)
* Currently doing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.

This is Github, so code. Some of the repositories I've made and worked with enough that it forking them made sense are [here](https://github.com/ionymikler)

Taken some pretty neat courses so far:
1. Advance Deep Learning for Computer Vision [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)
2. [A MidSummer's Bayesian Dream](bayesian/midSummer_Bayesian.md). Something cool I learned in a logical theories class.
3. On the topic of Logic: I worked will [Elle McFarlane](https://github.com/ellemcfarlane) on seeing how epistemic logic could be used to help in the learning process of a reinforcement learning agents. This was the final work of the same cool class mentioned above. The work is [here](logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf)
4. On the topic of RL: I'm studying right now how Reinforcement Learning works in Multi-Agent Systems, on a special course on the subject. Nothing crazy yet, but I'm sure I'll have something to share (hopefully).
