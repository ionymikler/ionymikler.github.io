**Welcome to my personal website!**

* I am a Robotics Engineer in love with the field. Mobile Robots being the what and Reinforcement Learning (partially at least) the how.
* Currently pursuing my Masters in Autonomous Systems at the Technical University of Denmark.
  * The code to some of my projects can be found [here](https://github.com/ionymikler).
  * My CV is available here: [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZU4Mqzy72IL_R7KR-ndILqpjZupWLtq?usp=drive_link)
  * LinkedIn: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmikler/)

This website is (**always**) a work in progress...
This place serves a double purpose.
1. As an archive of work I've done before, for now with the purpose of showing potential employers what I've done.
2. As a place to share some of the things I've learned and found interesting.

# Professional Background
Please check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZU4Mqzy72IL_R7KR-ndILqpjZupWLtq?usp=drive_link) for a more detailed description of my professional background. Here are some highlights:
1. **Robotics Engineer Student** @ [Agri-Robot](https://agrirobot.ai/) Currently
2. **Robotics Engineer** @ [Blue White Robotics](https://www.bluewhite.co/) 2020-2022
3. **Test Engineer** @ [Blue White Robotics](https://www.bluewhite.co/) 2019-2020

# Academic Background
## I've taken some interesting courses so far:
1. [Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02501)

   Main project: Detection Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection. Check the poster [here](courses/adlcv/adlcv_poster.pdf). The code is available [here](https://github.com/esquivelrs/MonoDETR) and notes are [here](https://ludicrous-camel-09d.notion.site/MonoDETR-d3569c480d4e44159c68b9c1c27461ff)
      * Partially disconnecting the depth-estimator lead to better performance and lower variance during training.
      * Proposing use of *disentangled* losses to improve kearning (inspired by Cube R-CNN).
      * Replaced the visual encoder with a faster one from RT-DETR to explore real-time usage.
      * Reduced Backbone size to compare performance and speed.

   Other projects:
   1. Visual Transformer for Image Classification
   2. Diffusion Models to Generate (guided and not) 16x16 game sprites.
   3. Novel View Generation with NeRFs (my favourite)

1. Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Agent Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02285)
   
   Main Project: Multi-Agent planning with PDDL; planner algorithms for multi-agent systems. [Code](https://github.com/ionymikler/MultiAgentPlanner)

2. Advanced Image Analysis Learning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02506)
   
   Main Project: Probabilistic Deformable Models for Image Segmentation. [Poster](courses/adv_img_analysis/AdvImgAnalysis_Poster.pdf)

3. Perception for Autonomous Systems - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/34759)

4. Logical Theories for Uncertainty and Planning - [Course Description](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02287)

   Main Project: Epistemic Logic for Reinforcement Learning. [Report](courses/logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf)

5. On the topic of RL: I'm currently studying how Reinforcement Learning works in Multi-Agent Systems, on a special course dedicated to the subject. Nothing too crazy yet, but I'm sure I'll have something to share (hopefully).

## Here are some blog posts related to the topics I've studied:
1. On the topic of Logic: I studied how epistemic logic could be used to help in the learning process of reinforcement learning agents. This was the final work of that class. The work is available [here](courses/logicalTheories/del-marl.pdf) and was done together with [Elle McFarlane](https://github.com/ellemcfarlane) a great AI engineer if you need one.
2. [A Midsummer's Bayesian Dream](bayesian/midSummer_Bayesian.md): Something cool I learned in a logical theories class (Under process...)

## Other projects:
I develop on a need-to-have basis these two `shell` toolboxes:
1. Generic Shell Toolbox: [Shell Toolbox](https://github.com/ionymikler/generic_shell_toolbox)
2. ROS Shell Toolbox: [ROS Shell Toolbox](https://github.com/ionymikler/ROS_shell_toolbox)
